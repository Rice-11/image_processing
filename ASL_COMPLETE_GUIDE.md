**A professional-grade ASL letter recognition system using MediaPipe and Neural Networks**

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start (3 Steps)**

### **Step 1: Collect Training Data** ⏱️ *10-15 minutes*
```bash
python asl_data_collector.py
```

**What to do:**
- Press **A** to select letter 'A'
- Make the ASL sign for 'A' with your hand
- Press **SPACE** to start collecting samples
- Keep your hand steady - it will automatically collect 50 samples
- Repeat for letters **B**, **C**, **D**, etc.
- Press **S** to save when done

**Tips for best results:**
- ✅ Good lighting on your hand
- ✅ Keep hand centered in camera view
- ✅ Hold pose steady for each collection
- ✅ Collect at least 30-50 samples per letter

### **Step 2: Train the Model** ⏱️ *5-10 minutes*
```bash
python asl_model_trainer.py
```

**What happens:**
- Automatically loads your collected data
- Trains a neural network (typically 90%+ accuracy)
- Shows training progress and results
- Saves the trained model for use

### **Step 3: Live Recognition** ⏱️ *Immediate*
```bash
python asl_live_predictor.py
```

**What you'll see:**
- Live camera feed with hand tracking
- Real-time ASL letter predictions
- Confidence scores and smooth filtering
- Professional UI with prediction display

## 📋 **System Requirements**

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

**Hardware:**
- Webcam (built-in or external)
- Python 3.7+ with decent CPU/GPU

## 🎯 **Complete Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Data Collection Interface**

**Script: `asl_data_collector.py`**

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time MediaPipe hand tracking with visual feedback
- ✅ Interactive letter selection (A-Y, excluding motion letters J,Z)
- ✅ Automatic sample counting with progress bars
- ✅ Quality assurance - only collects when hand is detected
- ✅ Professional UI with collection status
- ✅ Data saved in structured JSON format

**Controls:**
- **Letter keys (A-Y)**: Select which letter to collect
- **SPACE**: Start/stop sample collection
- **S**: Save collected data
- **Q**: Quit application

### **Phase 2: Neural Network Training**

**Script: `asl_model_trainer.py`**

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic data loading from collection phase
- ✅ Data preprocessing with normalization and stratified splitting
- ✅ Deep neural network with batch normalization and dropout
- ✅ Advanced training with early stopping and learning rate reduction
- ✅ Comprehensive evaluation with confusion matrix
- ✅ Model serialization with all metadata

**Architecture:**
```
Input (63 features) → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 → Output (24 classes)
BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout at each layer
```

**Outputs:**
- Trained model file (`.h5`)
- Label encoder (class mapping)
- Normalization parameters
- Training visualizations
- Performance metrics

### **Phase 3: Real-Time Recognition**

**Script: `asl_live_predictor.py`**

**Features:**
- ✅ MediaPipe hand tracking with enhanced landmark visualization
- ✅ Real-time neural network inference
- ✅ Prediction smoothing to reduce flickering
- ✅ Confidence-based filtering
- ✅ Professional live UI with prediction display
- ✅ Adjustable confidence thresholds
- ✅ FPS monitoring and performance optimization

**UI Elements:**
- Live prediction display with large letter
- Confidence score and visual bar
- Hand tracking with landmarks and bounding box
- Instructions and controls
- Model status and FPS counter

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Format**
- **Input**: 21 MediaPipe hand landmarks (x,y,z coordinates)
- **Features**: 63-dimensional vector (21 landmarks × 3 coordinates)
- **Normalization**: Relative to wrist position + statistical normalization
- **Output**: 24 ASL letters (A-Y excluding J,Z)

### **Model Details**
- **Type**: Fully Connected Neural Network
- **Input Layer**: 63 features
- **Hidden Layers**: [256, 128, 64, 32] with BatchNorm, ReLU, Dropout
- **Output Layer**: 24 classes with Softmax
- **Loss**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate scheduling

### **Why This Approach Works**
1. **MediaPipe Landmarks**: More robust than image classification
2. **Relative Coordinates**: Invariant to hand position and size
3. **Proper Normalization**: Handles different users and conditions
4. **Neural Network**: Learns complex hand shape patterns
5. **Prediction Smoothing**: Stable real-time performance

## 📊 **Expected Performance**

With proper data collection:
- **Training Accuracy**: 95-98%
- **Test Accuracy**: 90-95%
- **Real-time FPS**: 25-30 FPS
- **Inference Time**: ~5ms per prediction
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Data Collection Issues**
❌ **Hand not detected**
- Check lighting - ensure good illumination
- Keep hand in center of camera view
- Try adjusting camera angle

❌ **Low sample count**
- Hold pose steady during collection
- Ensure hand is clearly visible
- Check for camera permissions

### **Training Issues**
❌ **Low accuracy**
- Collect more samples (50+ per letter)
- Ensure data quality during collection
- Try training for more epochs

❌ **Model not saving**
- Check disk space
- Verify write permissions in directory

### **Live Prediction Issues**
❌ **No predictions showing**
- Check model files exist
- Verify camera is working
- Try lowering confidence threshold (press 'c')

❌ **Flickering predictions**
- Increase prediction buffer size in code
- Ensure steady hand positioning
- Check lighting consistency

## 🎨 **Customization Options**

### **Adjust Model Architecture**
Edit `asl_model_trainer.py`, function `create_model()`:
```python
# Add more layers for complexity
layers.Dense(512),  # Bigger first layer
layers.Dense(256),  # More layers
```

### **Modify Data Collection**
Edit `asl_data_collector.py`:
```python
self.target_samples = 100  # More samples per letter
self.asl_letters = ['A', 'B', 'C']  # Custom letter set
```

### **Tune Live Prediction**
Edit `asl_live_predictor.py`:
```python
self.confidence_threshold = 0.8  # Higher confidence
self.prediction_buffer = deque(maxlen=20)  # More smoothing
```
